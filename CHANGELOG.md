# @simondotm/nx-firebase Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## v0.3.0

Project has been renamed from `@simondotm/nxfirebase` to `@simondotm/nx-firebase` to better match Nx plugin naming conventions. Took a deep breath and did it early before many installs occurred. Apologies to any users who this may have inconvenienced - I didn't realise I could deprecate packages until after I'd deleted & renamed the pnm project. Rest assured, I won't be making any further major modifications like this!

If you have already generated NxFirebase applications using `@simondotm/nxfirebase` you will need to migrate as follows:

1. `npm uninstall @simondotm/nxfirebase`
2. `npm install @simondotm/nx-firebase --save-dev`
3. Update the `builder` targets in any NxFirebase applications you already have in your `workspace.json` or `angular.json` config from `@simondotm/nxfirebase:build` to `@simondotm/nx-firebase:build`

## v0.2.3

Built against Nx 12.3.4


**Updates**

- `build` executor now supports `--watch` option for incremental builds

- Added `serve` target to applications which will build the application with `--with-deps` and `--watch` options, and also launch the Firebase emulator with the application's firebase configuration in parallel

- Added `deploy` target to applications. Supports Nx forwarded command line arguments so commands like `nx deploy <appname> --only functions` work fine

- Default template function `index.ts` now has added import of `firebase-admin` to ensure all necessary Firebase package dependencies for functions are included out of the box

**Fixes**

- Default `firebase.appname.json` now has a valid default hosting configuration and apps ship with a template `public/index.html` (as generated by Firebase CLI) inside the application folder

- Nx-Firebase App generator sets `target` in `tsconfig.app.ts` to `es2018` to ensure Node 10 compatibility for Firebase Functions (for scenarios where root workspace `tsconfig.base.json` may be set to a later ES target)

- Fixed `predeploy` scripts in `firebase.appname.json` to use `npx nx` so that they work correctly in CI environments

- Fixed default `firestore.rules` file to correct a typo

- Fixed default `storage.rules` file to use version 2 ruleset

- Plugin peer dependencies set so there's some indication of plugin compatibility


## v0.2.2 - Initial Release

Built against Nx 12.1.1
